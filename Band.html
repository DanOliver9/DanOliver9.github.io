			<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
			<p class="p.wrap"> Known globally as one of the most influential and popular rock bands of all-time, in the 21st Century 'Led Zeppelin' is a household name. Made up by 4 of the world's greatest musical talents, Zeppelin continued to deliver throughout their imcredible career. They formed in 1968 after the band 'The Yardbirds' broke up. Jimmy Page had recently changed from Bass to lead Guitar and wanted to join forces with the other guitarist of Yardbirds, Jeff Beck. They recorded one song with John Paul Jones who straight away knew he wanted to join Jimmy. But Jimmy knew he needed to put together a crew and chose Robert Plant as the vocalist who then recommended John Bonham on drums. The name of the band name came from a conversation between zeppelin members and members of 'the who' that claimed a super group would go down like a 'lead zeppelin'. </p>

			<h3><b>Jimmy Page</b></h3>
			<a href="https://www.jimmypage.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="./Content/Images/Page_with_bow.jpg" title="Jimmy_with_bow" alt="Jimmy_with_bow" hspace="50" vspace="20" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px;"></a>
			<p class="p.wrap">Considered one of the greatest guitarists and producers ever.  Jimmy was originally in a band called the 'The Yardbirds' before they broke up and formed 'Led Zeppelin' with bandmate John. Page mostly used a Gibson Les Paul with a Marshall amp but was also a fan of the Fender Telecaster. I personally love Jimmy Page as he was able to create such a wide array of sounds and could invoke any emotion using both complex and simple tabs. His iconic solo in “Stairway to Heaven” is widely considered the best ever and is widely known. Jimmy Page is also well known for playing his guitar with a bow and instrumenting with feedback devices such as the wah-wah peddle. Producing most of the albums the band released he has to be considered as the main reason for Led Zeppelin and an absolute rock legend.</p>

			<h3><b>Robert Plant</b></h3>
			<a href="https://www.robertplant.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="./Content/Images/led-zep-robert-plant-02.jpg" title="Robert_Plant" alt="Robert_Plant_Singing" hspace="50" vspace="20" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px;"></a>
			<p class="p.wrap">Robert Plant was the Vocalist and Lyricist for Zeppelin. His voice is beyond comparaison to that of any other rock and roll singers. On stage he exuded a sexual aura that was impossible to ignore. He had long blond hair, wore tight jeans, was always bare-chested, and constantly had his hands on his hips during shows. Plant had an abundance of swagger that defined the “god of rock ‘n roll” persona. After Led Zeppelin broke up, he had a pretty successful solo career and even collaborated with Jimmy Page. Many vocalists have imitated his sound such as Jeff Buckley, Sammy Hagar, and Freddy Mercury. The encyclopedia defines Page’s vocals: “Exaggerating the vocal style and expressive palette of blues singers such as Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, Robert Plant created the sound that has defined much hard rock and heavy metal singing: a high range, an abundance of distortion, loud volume, and emotional excess”.</p>

			<h3><b>John Paul Jones</b></h3>
			<a href="https://www.johnpauljones.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="./Content/Images/john-paul-jones.jpg" title="John_Paul_Jones" alt="John_Paul_Jones" hspace="50" vspace="20" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px;"></a>
			<p class="p.wrap">John Paul Jones  was the bassist, mandolinist, and keyboardist for Led Zeppelin. He also played a number of other instruments on various recordings and played a major role in producing and composing Zeppelin’s records. Before led zeppelin he worked with cat stevens and donovan. His tools of choice were Fender jazz Bass and Gibson Mandolin. Although the spotlight was often on the more flashy members of the band, many people believe John Paul Jones and his memorable Bass lines is one of the more important members of the group. John Paul Jones has influenced a number of famous bassists including Gene Simmons and is currently a member of Them Crooked Vultures.</p>
			<p class="p.wrap"><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
			
			<h3><b>John Bonham</b></h3>
			<a href="https://www.johnbonham.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="./Content/Images/john_bonham_.jpg" title="John_Bonham" alt="John_Bonham" hspace="50" vspace="20" style="float:left; width:200px; height:200px;"></a>
			<p class="p.wrap"> Not suprisingly, Bonham is also considered one of the best ever at his role. John Bonham was the drummer and songwriter for Led Zeppelin and was well known for his great power and speed while still flowing perfectly with the groove of the song. Also known as The Beast, he sadly drank himself to death in 1980 after consuming nearly 40 shots of vodka in a single day. He played on Premier drums and was able to do more with one bass drum than any other human being could with three. Many musicians are quoted as saying that nobody will ever come close to John Bonham’s level.
